<p>A Gizmo is an advanced piece of media or interactivity placed on the page. At a technical level, it is a web component, but to your users and content readers it's an advanced piece of functionality helping them complete a task. Maybe they want to embed an article from Wikipedia, or create a gorgeous, responsive video. How would they do that without advanced code knowledge?</p>
<p>Gizmo's ensure that your users have a consistent visual presentation and authoring experience across a myriad of complex functionality. Any web component can be wired to support HAX.</p>
