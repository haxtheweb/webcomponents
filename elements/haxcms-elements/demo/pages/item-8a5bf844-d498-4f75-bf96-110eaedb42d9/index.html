<p>HAX is a radically simple way to create, share, and remix web content. The goal of HAX is simple: to help people create rich and engaging web content without needing to understand web code.</p>

<p slot="col-1">In the 90's, when the web really caught on, it was difficult to design and develop web content, but it was easy to maintain and anyone could participate with minor technical ability. As tools have evolved, the web became a feature rich, design centric place that we know and use today but the complexity curve went way up to achieve that.</p>

<p>HAX seeks to bring the web to the level of sustainability of the 90's web but without technical barriers to participate. It does this by encapsulating complexity using modern tools, yet saving everything in a portable, human readable format. As evidence, this website is built using HAX and is entirely static content that could be downloaded as a single zip file and moved easily.</p>
