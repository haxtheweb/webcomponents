<p>HAXiam (<i>HAX-I-Am</i>
) is a SaaS platform code base that's used to deploy HAXcms to multiple people. It is an abstraction on the HAXcms code base that enables it to be used by multiple users from a single point of deployment.</p>
<p>HAXiam leverages the hooks built into HAXcms to allow for integration with Enterprise login providers, making it a perfect fit for organizations looking to provide their users with micro-site publishing.</p>
<p>It's still early on but you can <a href="https://github.com/haxtheweb/haxiam/">check out HAXiam on github</a>
