  The Jovian planets - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - probably have cores
  (suspected to be liquid metal for Jupiter and Saturn, but primarily ice for
  Uranus and Neptune), but are &#8220;mostly atmospheres,&#8221; comprised of dense gas.
  Below are photographs of the planets by robotic probes, and an artist&#8217;s
  diagram of their interiors. The Jovian interiors are composed primarily of

) and related molecules. The
  Jovian planets thus reflect better the original material than the terrestrial
  planets where most of the gases have escaped.

  Given the extremely high pressures at the interface with any surface, it seems
  unlikely that the Jovian planets harbor living organisms. We will therefore
  review them briefly and concentrate instead on their moons which seem more
  likely sites for life.

  <b>
  Jupiter</b>
 has more mass than all of the other planets put together, and is only
  about 1&#8260;10 the mass it would need to initiate deuterium fusion reactions in
  its core (the &#8220;easiest&#8221; type of fusion for a star). Thanks to its mass and
  10-year orbit, Jupiter would likely be the first planet discovered by an alien
  civilization searching for planets around our Sun using techniques like those
  we use today (as we will discuss in the final unit of the course). Jupiter
  shines more brightly in the night sky than any star, and is outshined only by
  the Moon and Venus. Its strong magnetic field causes occasional bright radio
  flares brighter than any other radio phenomenon in the Solar System apart from
  the Sun. Its atmosphere exhibits bands caused by high-altitude winds and
  gargantuan hurricane-like stoms, including the famous &#8220;Red Spot&#8221; storm, which
  is roughly the size of ten Earths and has persisted in its atmosphere for more
  than three centuries. Jupiter has four large moons, discovered by Galileo,
  that rival Mercury in size and some of which may offer suitable habitats for
  life, as we discuss below and will explore further in the weeks ahead.

  <b>
  Saturn</b>
 is a less massive, more distant version of Jupiter exhibiting similar
  visual colors, including banded high-velocity clouds and storms, and having a
  similar atmospheric composition. Its appearance in telescopes is the most
  dramatic of all the planets, thanks to its giant ring system, likely the
  disrupted remains of a moon that wandered too close to the planet in the
  relatively recent past (less than 1 Ga ago) and was torn apart by Saturn&#8217;s
  tidal forces. Saturn has a single massive moon, Titan, roughly the size of
  Mercury, the only planetary satellite in the Solar System to have a
  substantial atmosphere and weather. Titan is another possible habitat for life
  which we will explore in more detail in the weeks ahead. Saturn, easily
  observed with the naked eye, is the most distant (slowest moving) of the
  planets known to ancient astronomers.

  <b>
  Uranus and Neptune</b>
 have been called the &#8220;ice giants&#8221; because they exist in the
  cold outer reaches of the Solar System and exhibit atmospheres with
  significant ice content and a different mix of gases than Jupiter and Saturn,
  giving them their blue-green (or if you prefer, cyan) appearance in
  visual-light images. Both are too faint to be seen with the naked eye (with
  ocassional exceptions for Uranus), and were not discovered until after
  telescopes were in widespread astronomical use. Uranus is noted for the
  unusual 97 degree tilt of its rotational axis, which means it effectively
  rolls around the Solar System on its side instead of spinning like a top as
  the other planets do (Venus can be considered to be upside down, and spins
  slowly, which is also unusual). Neptune has a single massive moon, Triton,
  which orbits in the &#8220;wrong&#8221; (retrograde) direction and so is thought to be a
  captured Kuiper Belt object. Triton&#8217;s properties, including its very tenuous
  nitrogen atmosphere, are very similar to those of Pluto and other massive
  Kuiper Belt objects, and with current understanding it is too cold and too far
  from the Sun to possibly support life.

  Jupiter has four large inner moons discovered by Galileo: Io, Europa,
  Ganymede, and Callisto. The pictures here are from the Galileo robot probe
  launched by NASA that orbited Jupiter and photographed its moons from
  1995-2003.

  <b>
  Io</b>
 is closest to Jupiter and, subjected to enormous tidal forces of the giant
  planet, should have its spin locked to its orbital period like our Moon&#8217;s spin
  is locked to its orbit, with the same side always facing its planet. But the
  pull of the next moon out, Europa, disturbs Io&#8217;s orbit, with the result that
  Io is constantly being &#8220;massaged&#8221; by Jupiter&#8217;s tidal forces, which heat and
  melt its icy and rocky interior. As a result, Io is the most volcanically
  active body in the Solar System (below). With many constantly erupting
  volcanos, its surface covered with recent lava flows, and its complete lack of
  any atmosphere, Io&#8217;s surface and interior are probably too harsh and unstable
  for life.

  <b>
  Europa</b>
 (below, left) has an icy surface with long dark cracks and no craters.
  These surfaces show evidence of having been repeatedly melted and refrozen.
  Models of this phenomenon suggest there is a large ocean beneath a thick icy
  crust that may contain more liquid water than exists in all the oceans of
  Earth. As with Io, tidal forces of Jupiter likely provide sufficient heat to
  keep this water from freezing. The evidence for existence of these oceans,
  their likely properties, and their potential for harboring life will be a
  focus for us in the weeks ahead.

<p data-hax-grid>
  
  
  
  
  
  <b>
  Ganymede</b>
 (below, right) and Callisto exhibit relatively young surfaces that,
  again, suggest the presence of large quantities of liquid water - or, at the
  very least, &#8220;slush&#8221; - below the surface of both moons, again because of
  Jupiter&#8217;s tidal influence, combined with the tidal forces of the other inner
  moons. We will discuss prospects for life on these moons as well.

  Saturn&#8217;s moons, discovered by Christian Huygens in the 1600s, are now being
  investigated by the Cassini probe which arrived there in 2005. There are
  dozens of moons, most with ancient icy surfaces covered in craters. Some have
  large cracks suggesting heating and expansion from large collisions. Saturn&#8217;s
  largest moon is Titan, the only moon with a substantial atmosphere and
  observed weather patterns. The surface features are invisible due to clouds
  (below, left), and models suggest that Titan may have liquid

  Cassini dropped a research probe named Huygens (built by the European Space
  Agency) onto Titan in 2005. It took some remarkable photos during its descent
  (below, center) and after landing on the surface (below, right) - the only
  visible light photos we have of the surface of this alien world. The last
  photo shows stream-beds kilometers in length and surface material with a mix
  of light and dark colors. It is much too cold for liquid water; the liquid
  seen flowing on Titan&#8217;s surface (center) is likely to be methane or ethane.
