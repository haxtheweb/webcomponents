<p>Community pillars are not just what we focus on but who we are, what we build and what it does for others. They are our compass in hopes that we continue to point toward true north in all that we do. It is not the goal of this project to throw off the shackles of past vendors and unsustainable ecosystems simply to create a new one. We do not disrupt to make a market but to make a better planet.</p>
