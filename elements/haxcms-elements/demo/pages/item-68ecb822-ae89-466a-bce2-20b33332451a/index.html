  Earth&#8217;s interior is still mostly molten from its formation 4.5 billion years
  ago. The solid crust of light silicates is very thin: only 5-50 km (vs. total
  radius of 6400 km). Under the thin crust is a thick mantle of melted
  silicates, a liquid outer core, and an inner core of solid iron/nickel.

  Earth&#8217;s surface features are explained by <i>plate tectonics</i>
. First introduced by
  Alfred Wegener in the 1930s and largely disparaged at the time, it is now

  motions. The Earth&#8217;s surface is broken into ~20 
  
  
  
  
  
  <i>crustal plates</i>
, which are
  moved in different directions by convection currents in the mantle. New crust
  forms by uplift and spreading of mantle material at mid-oceanic ridges, with
  the newest rock along the ridge line. Old crust is either 
  
  
  
  
  
  <i>subducted</i>
 into the
  mantle along a trench, or is crumpled upward into mountain ranges (e.g. the
  Himalaya Mountains being produced today as the Indian plate crashes into the

  Earth is unique among the planets in having a relatively large-sized moon -
  the Moon, which is 1&#8260;80 the mass of Earth and orbits at a distance of 55 Earth
  radii. For this reason the Earth-Moon system is occasionally referred to
  somewhat humorously as a &#8220;binary planet&#8221;. The most likely way for such a
  massive and nearby Moon to have been formed is by a cataclysmic collision,
  towards the end of the formation of the Solar System, between the proto-Earth
  and another roughly Mars-sized planetesimal. The collision would have ejected
  a large amount of Earth&#8217;s crust into orbit, where it could have collected into
  the spherical body we see today. Key consequences of Earth&#8217;s large Moon for
  life on Earth are that it raises large tides in our oceans, and stabilizes the
  tilt of Earth&#8217;s axis (which is responsible for the seasons) over very long
  timescales. Tides in the Earth-Moon system are also slowing down Earth&#8217;s
  rotation, and hence, the length of a day: At the time of the dinosaurs, each
  day was ~23 hours long, and currently the day is lengthening by 2 milliseconds
  per century.

The origin of the Valles Marineris remains unknown, although a leading hypothesis holds that it started as a crack billions of years ago as the planet cooled.

  The red color is from oxidized iron-rich minerals (i.e. rust). Some regions
  are heavily cratered - these are more ancient surfaces that have not changed

  more recently by lava (volcanism) or water erosion. The region of the planet

  Mars is now mostly cooled to a solid, but had a molten interior for much of
  its history. For some period (up to ~2 billion years ago?), active volcanism
  brought molten rock up from the interior. Most remarkably, small features
  around certain canyons and craters suggest that liquid water once flowed on
  Mars. Possibly due to a greenhouse effect and global warming from gases
  ejected by volcanos. Today nearly all the water on the surface is frozen. Only
  very recently have scientists found evidence for liquid water briefly being
  exposed on the surface of Mars (before sublimating or freezing). Carl Sagan
  and others suggest that life may have formed on Mars during its wet period.
  Following are some of the remarkable photos taken by Mars orbiters during the

  The interior of Mars is mostly solid, unlike Earth&#8217;s interior that is molten.
  This is because Mars is smaller and less massive (about 1&#8260;10 the mass of
  Earth) and hence has cooled faster since its formation 4.5 billion years ago.
  (Mercury and the Moon are even smaller and have entirely cooled.) Earth&#8217;s
  surface is very young, constantly remade by erosion (rain, rivers), volcanic
  lava flows, and plate tectonics. Mars&#8217;s surface is partly old with many impact
  craters, and partly newer with lava flows and water erosion. The surfaces of
  planets thus reflect conditions in the planetary interiors.
