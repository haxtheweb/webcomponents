  Earth&#8217;s surface features are explained by <i>plate tectonics</i>
. First introduced by
  Alfred Wegener in the 1930s and largely disparaged at the time, it is now

  <i>crustal plates</i>

  moved in different directions by convection currents in the mantle. New crust
  forms by uplift and spreading of mantle material at mid-oceanic ridges, with

  <i>subducted</i>
 into the

  Earth is unique among the planets in having a relatively large-sized moon -
  the Moon, which is 1&#8260;80 the mass of Earth and orbits at a distance of 55 Earth
  radii. For this reason the Earth-Moon system is occasionally referred to
  somewhat humorously as a &#8220;binary planet&#8221;. The most likely way for such a
  massive and nearby Moon to have been formed is by a cataclysmic collision,
  towards the end of the formation of the Solar System, between the proto-Earth
  and another roughly Mars-sized planetesimal. The collision would have ejected
  a large amount of Earth&#8217;s crust into orbit, where it could have collected into
  the spherical body we see today. Key consequences of Earth&#8217;s large Moon for
  life on Earth are that it raises large tides in our oceans, and stabilizes the
  tilt of Earth&#8217;s axis (which is responsible for the seasons) over very long
  timescales. Tides in the Earth-Moon system are also slowing down Earth&#8217;s
  rotation, and hence, the length of a day: At the time of the dinosaurs, each
  day was ~23 hours long, and currently the day is lengthening by 2 milliseconds
  per century.

  Mars is now mostly cooled to a solid, but had a molten interior for much of
  its history. For some period (up to ~2 billion years ago?), active volcanism
  brought molten rock up from the interior. Most remarkably, small features
  around certain canyons and craters suggest that liquid water once flowed on
  Mars. Possibly due to a greenhouse effect and global warming from gases
  ejected by volcanos. Today nearly all the water on the surface is frozen. Only
  very recently have scientists found evidence for liquid water briefly being
  exposed on the surface of Mars (before sublimating or freezing). Carl Sagan
  and others suggest that life may have formed on Mars during its wet period.

  The interior of Mars is mostly solid, unlike Earth&#8217;s interior that is molten.
  This is because Mars is smaller and less massive (about 1&#8260;10 the mass of
  Earth) and hence has cooled faster since its formation 4.5 billion years ago.
  (Mercury and the Moon are even smaller and have entirely cooled.) Earth&#8217;s
  surface is very young, constantly remade by erosion (rain, rivers), volcanic
  lava flows, and plate tectonics. Mars&#8217;s surface is partly old with many impact
  craters, and partly newer with lava flows and water erosion. The surfaces of
  planets thus reflect conditions in the planetary interiors.

  Jupiter</b>

  about 1&#8260;10 the mass it would need to initiate deuterium fusion reactions in
  its core (the &#8220;easiest&#8221; type of fusion for a star). Thanks to its mass and
  10-year orbit, Jupiter would likely be the first planet discovered by an alien
  civilization searching for planets around our Sun using techniques like those
  we use today (as we will discuss in the final unit of the course). Jupiter
  shines more brightly in the night sky than any star, and is outshined only by
  the Moon and Venus. Its strong magnetic field causes occasional bright radio
  flares brighter than any other radio phenomenon in the Solar System apart from
  the Sun. Its atmosphere exhibits bands caused by high-altitude winds and
  gargantuan hurricane-like stoms, including the famous &#8220;Red Spot&#8221; storm, which
  is roughly the size of ten Earths and has persisted in its atmosphere for more
  than three centuries. Jupiter has four large moons, discovered by Galileo,
  that rival Mercury in size and some of which may offer suitable habitats for
  life, as we discuss below and will explore further in the weeks ahead.

  disrupted remains of a moon that wandered too close to the planet in the
  relatively recent past (less than 1 Ga ago) and was torn apart by Saturn&#8217;s
  tidal forces. Saturn has a single massive moon, Titan, roughly the size of
  Mercury, the only planetary satellite in the Solar System to have a

  Uranus and Neptune</b>
 have been called the &#8220;ice giants&#8221; because they exist in the
  cold outer reaches of the Solar System and exhibit atmospheres with
  significant ice content and a different mix of gases than Jupiter and Saturn,
  giving them their blue-green (or if you prefer, cyan) appearance in
  visual-light images. Both are too faint to be seen with the naked eye (with
  ocassional exceptions for Uranus), and were not discovered until after
  telescopes were in widespread astronomical use. Uranus is noted for the
  unusual 97 degree tilt of its rotational axis, which means it effectively
  rolls around the Solar System on its side instead of spinning like a top as
  the other planets do (Venus can be considered to be upside down, and spins
  slowly, which is also unusual). Neptune has a single massive moon, Triton,
  which orbits in the &#8220;wrong&#8221; (retrograde) direction and so is thought to be a
  captured Kuiper Belt object. Triton&#8217;s properties, including its very tenuous
  nitrogen atmosphere, are very similar to those of Pluto and other massive
  Kuiper Belt objects, and with current understanding it is too cold and too far

  Io</b>
 is closest to Jupiter and, subjected to enormous tidal forces of the giant
  planet, should have its spin locked to its orbital period like our Moon&#8217;s spin
  is locked to its orbit, with the same side always facing its planet. But the
  pull of the next moon out, Europa, disturbs Io&#8217;s orbit, with the result that
  Io is constantly being &#8220;massaged&#8221; by Jupiter&#8217;s tidal forces, which heat and
  melt its icy and rocky interior. As a result, Io is the most volcanically
  active body in the Solar System (below). With many constantly erupting
  volcanos, its surface covered with recent lava flows, and its complete lack of
  any atmosphere, Io&#8217;s surface and interior are probably too harsh and unstable

  Europa</b>
 (below, left) has an icy surface with long dark cracks and no craters.
  These surfaces show evidence of having been repeatedly melted and refrozen.
  Models of this phenomenon suggest there is a large ocean beneath a thick icy
  crust that may contain more liquid water than exists in all the oceans of
  Earth. As with Io, tidal forces of Jupiter likely provide sufficient heat to
  keep this water from freezing. The evidence for existence of these oceans,
  their likely properties, and their potential for harboring life will be a
  focus for us in the weeks ahead.

 (below, right) and Callisto exhibit relatively young surfaces that,

  Jupiter&#8217;s tidal influence, combined with the tidal forces of the other inner
  moons. We will discuss prospects for life on these moons as well.

<p data-hax-grid>
  Saturn&#8217;s moons, discovered by Christian Huygens in the 1600s, are now being
  investigated by the Cassini probe which arrived there in 2005. There are
  dozens of moons, most with ancient icy surfaces covered in craters. Some have
  large cracks suggesting heating and expansion from large collisions. Saturn&#8217;s
  largest moon is Titan, the only moon with a substantial atmosphere and
  observed weather patterns. The surface features are invisible due to clouds
  (below, left), and models suggest that Titan may have liquid

  Cassini dropped a research probe named Huygens (built by the European Space
  Agency) onto Titan in 2005. It took some remarkable photos during its descent
  (below, center) and after landing on the surface (below, right) - the only
  visible light photos we have of the surface of this alien world. The last
  photo shows stream-beds kilometers in length and surface material with a mix
  of light and dark colors. It is much too cold for liquid water; the liquid
  seen flowing on Titan&#8217;s surface (center) is likely to be methane or ethane.

  Saturn&#8217;s moon Enceladus is another example of an icy moon like the Galilean
  satellites of Jupiter. The existence of liquid water under its surface has
  been confirmed by the Cassini mission&#8217;s observations of jets of water vapor
  erupting from its surface. We will discuss Enceladus along with Europa,
  Ganymede, and Callisto in the context of habitability.

  it orbits in the wrong direction, and its surface has two different terrains
  (smooth melted material, and rough colored material). The moon is extremely

  orbit, so it may have melted during its capture by Neptune long ago. But the
  surface has very few craters, so it must have been altered many times since
  the original capture.
