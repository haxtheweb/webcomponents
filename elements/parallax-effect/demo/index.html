          <div class="text">The legendary great white shark is far more fearsome in our imaginations than in reality. As
            scientific research
            on these elusive predators increases, their image as mindless killing machines is beginning to fade. Of the
            100-plus
            annual shark attacks worldwide, fully one-third to one-half are attributable to great whites. However, most of
            these are not fatal, and new research finds that great whites, who are naturally curious, are "sample biting"
            then
            releasing their victims rather than preying on humans. It's not a terribly comforting distinction, but it does
            indicate that humans are not actually on the great white's menu. Great whites are the largest predatory fish on
            Earth. They grow to an average of 15 feet in length, though specimens exceeding 20 feet and weighing up to
            5,000
            pounds have been recorded. They have slate-gray upper bodies to blend in with the rocky coastal sea floor, but
            get their name from their universally white underbellies. They are streamlined, torpedo-shaped swimmers with
            powerful
            tails that can propel them through the water at speeds of up to 15 miles per hour. They can even leave the
            water
            completely, breaching like whales when attacking prey from underneath.</div>

            large, blunt-nosed predators have a duly earned reputation as man-eaters. They are second only to great whites
            in attacking people. But because they have a near completely undiscerning palate, they are not likely to swim
            away
            after biting a human, as great whites frequently do. They are consummate scavengers, with excellent senses of
            sight
            and smell and a nearly limitless menu of diet items.</div>

          <div class="text">This shark's unusual name comes from the unusual shape of its head, an amazing piece of anatomy
            built to maximize
            the fish's ability to find its favorite meal: stingrays. A hammerhead shark uses its wide head to trap
            stingrays
            by pinning them to the seafloor. The shark's eye placement, on each end of its very wide head, allows it to
            scan
            more area more quickly than other sharks can. The hammerhead also has special sensors across its head that
            helps
            it scan for food in the ocean. Living creatures' bodies give off electrical signals, which are picked up by
            sensors
            on the prowling hammerhead. The shark hunts alone, and can find stingrays that hide under the sand on the
            seafloor.
            Hammerheads also eat bony fishes, crabs, squid, lobsters, and other sea creatures. The upper sides of these
            fish
            are grayish-brown or olive-green and they have white bellies. They have very impressive triangular, serrated
            teeth—like
            the edge of a saw's blade. Hammerheads' mouths are on the underside of their heads.</div>
