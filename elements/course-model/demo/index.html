                <p>This is a 3D representation of the M1911, also known as the
                  Colt 1911, or the Colt
                  Government, is a single-action, semi-automatic, magazine-fed,
                  recoil-operated pistol chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge.
                  It served as the standard-issue sidearm for the United States
                  Armed Forces from 1911 to 1985. It was widely used in World
                  War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War.</p>
                <p>Designed by John Browning, the M1911 is the best-known of
                  his designs to use the short recoil principle in its basic
                  design. The pistol was widely copied, and this operating
                  system rose to become the preeminent type of the 20th century
                  and of nearly all modern centerfire pistols.</p>
                <p>Following its success in trials, the Colt pistol was formally
                  adopted by the Army on March 29, 1911, when it was designated
                  Model of 1911, later changed to Model 1911, in 1917, and then
                  M1911, in the mid-1920s. The Director of Civilian Marksmanship
                  began manufacture of M1911 pistols for members of the National
                  Rifle Association in August 1912. Approximately 100 pistols
                  stamped "N.R.A." below the serial number were manufactured at
                  Springfield Armory and by Colt. The M1911 was formally
                  adopted by the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps in 1913. The .45 ACP
                  "Model of 1911 U.S. Army" was used by both US Army Cavalry
                  Troops and Infantry Soldiers during the United States'
                  Punitive Expedition into Mexico against Pancho Villa in
                  1916.
                </p>
                <p>By the beginning of 1917, a total of 68,533 M1911 pistols had
                  been delivered to U.S. armed forces by Colt's Patent Firearms
                  Manufacturing Company and the U.S. government's Springfield
                  Armory.
