# haxma-theme
DDD + Lit web component based on OpenWC toolchain. This is intended to provide the following:
- Look good via DDD, HAX design system
- Simple, easy to read code via Lit
- Great workflow via OpenWC tooling + Vercel for sharing demos
- Simplify contribution to the HAX ecosystem
- Publish and distribute via npmjs.com

## Install dependencies
- `npm install` - installs dependencies so you can work

## Commands
- `npm start` - runs your web component for development, reloading on file changes
- `npm run build` - builds your web component and outputs it in your `dist` directory for placement on web servers in a compiled form. Vercel automatically does this on commit to github.
- `npm run release` - this will build your code, update the version, and publish it to npm for others to use

## Working with your web component
- edit `./haxma-theme.js`
- edit your 'demo' by modifying `./index.html`
- add dependencies using `npm install --save @whatever/repo` or editing `./package.json` directly
- if you must reference additional non-JS files, ensure you use the `new URL('./my-file.jpg', import.meta.url).href` syntax so that it builds correctly
- if you add additional `.js` files / web components then place them under `/lib/`
- to improve HAX wiring edit file in `/lib/haxma-theme.haxProperties.json`
- for i18n / internationalization efforts, see associated language `.json` files in `/locales/` as well as `/lib/` for haxProperties related translation examples.
