        <h3>The Future of Docker: Docker and VMs Will&nbsp;Co-exist</h3>
        <p>While <glossary-term display="Docker" name="docker" endpoint="demo/glossary-terms/glossary-terms.json">Docker</glossary-term> is certainly gaining a lot of
          steam, I don’t believe it will become a real threat to <glossary-term display="VMs" name="virtual_machine">VMs
          </glossary-term>. <glossary-term name="container_virtualization" display="Containers">Containers
          </glossary-term> will continue to gain ground, but there are many use cases where VMs are still better suited.
        </p>
        <p>For instance, if you need to run multiple applications on multiple servers, it probably makes sense to use
          VMs. On the other hand, if you need to run many *copies* of a single application, Docker offers some
          compelling advantages.</p>
        <p>Moreover, while containers allow you to break your application into more functional discrete parts to create
          a separation of concerns, it also means there’s a growing number of parts to manage, which can get unwieldy.
        </p>
        <p>Security has also been an area of concern with Docker containers — since containers share the same kernel,
          the barrier between containers is thinner. While a full VM can only issue hypercalls to the host hypervisor, a
          Docker container can make syscalls to the host kernel, which creates a larger surface area for attack. When
          security is particularly important, developers are likely to pick VMs, which are isolated by abstracted
          hardware — making it much more difficult to interfere with each other.</p>
        <p>Of course, issues like security and management are certain to evolve as containers get more exposure in
          production and further scrutiny from users. For now, the debate about containers vs. VMs is really best off to
          dev ops folks who live and breathe them everyday!</p>
